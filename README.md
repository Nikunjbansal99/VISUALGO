# Introduction
<p>
Student retention defines the success of universities; higher retention ends up in higher success rate. Consequently, several strategies are proposed to stay the retention high. a number of them are- use of social media, Student Success Course, and the combination of educational technologies. To maintain the retention high in Computing education, educational technologies are often applied to assist students learn a selected topic. These technologies typically depend upon automated visualization as their main feature; a selected topic explained through intuitive graphics and animation. Algorithm Visualization (AV) tool is one in every of the foremost common one.

Data structure and Algorithms could be a fundamental course in computing. However, many students find it difficult because it requires critical thinking. It might be very helpful if there is a tool to visualize data structures like queues, array, stack, linked list and graphs for college students to experiment with. The tool would allow students to see the workings of operations in the form of changes that take place in the corresponding data structure. Moreover, the students can select the algorithm in order that the execution of the algorithm is animated. This tool may be used as a good supplement to the normal classroom education and textbooks for Data Structures and Algorithms courses.

# Objectives
● Visualize Algorithms.<br>
● Enhance user understanding about the working of various well-known algorithms.<br>
● To make a user-friendly interface so that the person using the application can easily provide the input and view the visualization.<br>
● Build a menu driven approach for user interaction with the software.<br>
● Create a well-documented and easily interpretable code for people understandings.<br>

# Algorithm
Step 1: Start<br>
Step 2: Step up the environment for the proper execution of a Console Graphic C file in Dev C++ along with graphics.h library.<br>
Step 3: Create a menu for the user using Switch case for choosing which algorithm or data structure he wants to visualize from the given list.<br>
Step 4: Create the various algorithm’s visualization with the help of graphics.h library.<br>
Step 5: Create algorithm visualization of –<br>
	* Linear Search<br>
	* Binary Search<br>
	* Bubble Sort<br>
	* Insertion Sort<br>
Step 6: Take input from the user for his choice.<br>
Step 7: Initialize the Window’s BGI window for the visualization of the algorithms.<br>
Step 8: Display the algorithm as chosen by the user.<br>
Step 9: Set a particular delay after which the algorithm finishes and the user clicks a key to exit.<br>
Step 10: Stop.<br>

</p>
● The methodology which we used is Agile Development. <br>
● This method is an iterative and incremental method in which the complete development of the application will be divided into sub tasks and each task will be considered as a small project in itself, i.e. fulfilling the objectives.<br>
